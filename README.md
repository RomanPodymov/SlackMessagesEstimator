[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/RomanPodymov/SlackMessagesEstimator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/RomanPodymov/SlackMessagesEstimator)

## Requirements

- macOS 10.15
- Xcode 11.2
- Swift 5.1

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but SlackMessagesEstimator does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding SlackMessagesEstimator as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

#### Swift 5.1

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/RomanPodymov/SlackMessagesEstimator.git", from: "0.0.1")
]
```
